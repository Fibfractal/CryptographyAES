# Purpose

The purpose is to learn AES encryption. This is a simple windows desktop application, which can encrypt and decrypt text. The app itself won't send the cipher, so you should copy and paste it to email and messenger. The encryption technique is symmetric AES encryption with an initialization vector. Both the sender and the receiver must have the app.


# Getting started

1. Open the solution and run the app.
2. In the encryption textbox at the top, type the plaintext to be encrypted, and press the encrypt button.
3. The ciphertext will appear in the middle textbox. Copy this and send it by messenger or email.
4. The receiver will copy the ciphertext to the middle textbox and press the decrypt button. The original plaintext will now appear in the bottom textbox.
